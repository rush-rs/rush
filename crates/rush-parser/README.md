# rush Parser

A crate which performs syntactic analysis on rush programs whilst creating an
[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

This crate implements a [lexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis)
and a [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) for the rush programming
language. This parser is a
[recursive descent parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser),
meaning it uses a top-down approach. For infix expressions, an
[operator precedence algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser)
is used. The AST generated by this crate is often validated and annotated by the
[`rush-analyzer`](https://github.com/rush-rs/rush/tree/main/crates/rush-analyzer)
before being fed into a compiler.
